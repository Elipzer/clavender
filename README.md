***
Lavender is an interpreted, pure functional REPL-based programming language. It supports built in floating point numbers and strings, with vectors, lists, hashtables, and functional monads implemented in the standard libraries. Lavender is untyped, and it represents all values as functions. Lavender takes inspiration primarily from C, Python, and Scala.

This repository contains an implementation of Lavender in the C programming language. The original Java implementation is still around for posterity, but may not be updated in the future.

Further documentation can be found on the [GitHub pages site](https://kvverti.github.io/lavender).
